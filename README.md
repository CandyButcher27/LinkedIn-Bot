## 🤖 LinkedIn Q&A Bot
A simple AI-powered bot that answers any question about you, using your LinkedIn profile and a summary as context. It’s ideal for job seekers, networkers, or anyone wanting an automated way to handle introductions, interviews, or FAQs.

## 🧠 What It Does
This bot:

Loads your LinkedIn profile and a short text summary about you

Uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to understand that information

Answers any question about your background, skills, education, or work experience as if it were you

## 🚀 How It Works
Input Sources

Your LinkedIn profile text (can be scraped/exported)

A summary.txt file (you write a short intro about yourself)

Processing

Both inputs are passed as system/user context to the LLM

User asks questions like “What are your skills?”, “Where have you worked?”, “What are your strengths?”

Response

The LLM answers naturally and informatively, pretending to be you

##💡 Use Cases
Replace your LinkedIn "About" section with an interactive bot

Share in job applications or emails to let people talk to your profile

Automate FAQs about you for interviews, networking, or demos

## 📌 Note
This bot does not directly connect to LinkedIn’s API

You need to manually provide the profile and summary

Ideal for use with OpenAI, Groq, Gemini, or any LLM provider

## 🔒 Privacy
All data stays local — your profile and summary are not shared or stored elsewhere unless you deploy it yourself.
