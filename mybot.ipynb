This often includes contributing to the planning and execution of key academic processes, coordinating efforts, and ensuring the smooth functioning of various initiatives for undergraduate students.\n",
      "2.  **Registration Guide (December 2024 - June 2025):** For seven months, I served as a Registration Guide. My main responsibility was to assist undergraduate students with their course registration process. This involved providing guidance on navigating the registration portal, clarifying academic policies, helping resolve any issues they encountered, and generally ensuring that students had a clear and straightforward experience during registration periods. It was very rewarding to directly support my peers.\n",
